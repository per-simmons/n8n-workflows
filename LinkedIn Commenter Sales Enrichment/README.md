# LinkedIn Commenter Sales Enrichment

## What It Does

This workflow transforms LinkedIn post engagement into qualified sales leads by extracting commenter data from your thought leadership posts and enriching it through Clay's data platform. Perfect for B2B companies that want to convert social engagement into sales conversations.

## How It Works

5. **Lead Qualification** - Clay processes leads through your enrichment waterfall
6. **Sales Handoff** - Enriched leads flow to your CRM or sales tools

# n8n Workflows

## What's in here?

Each folder has a complete workflow - just grab the JSON file and import it into your n8n instance. Everything's documented so you know what's what.

## The Workflows

### üîó [Link Capture System](Link%20Capture%20System/README.md)
This automation grabs links from Telegram, uses AI to figure out what they're about, and dumps everything into Airtable. I use it to save interesting stuff I find without having to manually organize everything.

### üé• [Video to Text](Video%20to%20Text/README.md)
Super simple but super useful. Takes videos from Google Drive and transcribes them using ElevenLabs. Great if you record meetings or make video notes and want them searchable.

### üîç [AI-Powered SEO Keyword Research](AI-Powered%20SEO%20Keyword%20Research%20Automation/README.md)
This is the big one. It does all the keyword research grunt work - finds related keywords, checks search volumes, analyzes competitors, the whole deal. Uses OpenAI and DataForSEO together to get really solid data.

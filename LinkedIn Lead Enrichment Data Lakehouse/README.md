## What It Does

This workflow automates the complete lead enrichment pipeline from LinkedIn engagement data through Clay's data enrichment platform to personalized outreach. Built for B2B companies targeting data-savvy prospects who engage with thought leadership content.

## How It Works

### The Complete Pipeline

1. **Scheduled Extraction** - Daily 9AM trigger launches LinkedIn scraping
2. **LinkedIn Engagement Mining** - PhantomBuster extracts comments, reactions, and profile data
3. **Data Transformation** - Structures raw LinkedIn data for Clay processing
4. **Clay Enrichment** - Enriches leads with company data, contact info, and technographics
5. **AI-Powered Lead Scoring** - GPT-4 grades leads based on title, company size, tech stack, and revenue

7. **CRM Integration** - Updates HubSpot with enriched data and lead scores
8. **Real-time Engagement Tracking** - Monitors email responses and creates deals automatically

### Lead Scoring Algorithm

The AI grader evaluates leads on:
- **Title/Seniority**: Director+ (30pts), Manager (20pts), IC (10pts)
- **Company Size**: >500 employees (20pts), 100-500 (15pts), <100 (5pts)
- **Tech Stack Match**: Competitor user (30pts), Cloud-native (20pts), Legacy (5pts)
- **Revenue**: >$50M (20pts), $10-50M (15pts), <$10M (5pts)

**Grade Assignments:**
- **Gold** (80-100 points): High-intent prospects with immediate outreach
- **Silver** (60-79 points): Warm prospects with educational nurturing
- **Bronze** (40-59 points): Long-term nurturing in CRM
